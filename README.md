# FrancisTorres_final_test_p2
This repository contains all required elements for the Final Test – Part 2.
This is used for Python code for the web app.
This file is used as the template for the web app.
Working with GitHub for this test allowed me to practice real-world version control workflows.  
Creating milestones and issues helped me plan the project in a structured way, similar to Agile project management. 
The process of cloning the repository locally reinforced how distributed teams collaborate on code using Git.

I also learned the importance of clear documentation, especially when working with version control systems where multiple contributors rely on organized commits, issues, and milestones.

Overall, this activity helped strengthen my understanding of Git, GitHub, and structured development practices.
